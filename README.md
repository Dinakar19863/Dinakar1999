# SMS SPAM DETECTION SYSTEM USING NLP PROJECT 01

Spam detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fascinating and practical application of AI. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of messages labeled as spam or ham (non-spam). A popular dataset for this purpose is the SMS Spam Collection from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the text data. This involves tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to standardize the text.

3. Feature Extraction: Convert the text into numerical features using techniques like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).

4. Model Training: Train machine learning models such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models like LSTM and Bi-LSTM.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing model.

6. Deployment: Deploy the final model as a web application or service to classify new messages as spam or ham.


This project involves building a spam email and sms detection system using machine learning and deploying it as a web application with Streamlit. The dataset used for this project is the "spam.csv" dataset, which contains labeled emails classified as spam or ham (non-spam). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify and detect spam emails based on features extracted from the email content.
